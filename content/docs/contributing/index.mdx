## Before You Start

Before you start contributing, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js (v22 or above recommended)
- npm (v10 or above) or yarn (optional)
- Git
- A code editor like VS Code

## Environment Setup

To set up your environment:

1. **Create environment file** - At the root of the project, create a `.env` file. See `.env.example` for reference

2. **Use recommended Node.js version**:
   ```bash
   # If you have nvm installed:
   nvm use
   
   # Or if you have fnm installed:
   fnm use
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Setting up Search (Meilisearch)

BetterGov uses Meilisearch to power its search functionality. To set up search for local development:

1. **Install and configure Meilisearch** - Follow the detailed setup guide in [Meilisearch Setup](/docs/meilisearch)
2. **Index your data** - Load government services and directory data into the search engine
3. **Test search functionality** - Verify everything works by searching on your local site

## Contribution Workflow

<Steps>

### Initial Setup

**Fork the Repository on GitHub**
- Go to the main project repository (`github.com/bettergovph/bettergov`)
- Click the **"Fork"** button to create a copy under your GitHub account

**Clone the Forked Repository to Local Machine**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bettergov.git
cd bettergov
```

**Add the Original Repository as an Upstream**
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bettergovph/bettergov.git
```

### Branch Creation

**Update local main before creating a new branch**
```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

**Create a New Feature Branch**

Use a prefix-based convention for clarity:

**Format:**
```
<prefix>/<short-description>
```

**Examples:**
- `feature/add-login-form`
- `fix/navbar-responsive-issue`
- `docs/add-contributing-and-code-of-conduct`

<Callout type="info">
Keep branch names short, descriptive, and kebab-case.
</Callout>

### Development Loop

**Make Changes**

Make sure your code passes linting and tests before committing.

```bash
git add .
git commit -a
```

**Commit Messages**

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.

**Format:**
```
<type>[optional scope]: <short description>
```

**Common Types Used:**
- `feat:` → A new feature
- `fix:` → A bug fix
- `docs:` → Documentation only changes
- `style:` → Code style or formatting changes (no logic)
- `refactor:` → Code refactoring (no feature or fix)
- `test:` → Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` → Maintenance tasks (build process, dependencies, etc.)

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(button): add primary button variant
fix(navbar): correct mobile menu toggle
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

**Push to the Forked Repository**
```bash
git push -u origin feat/add-new-component
```

**Sync with Upstream Again**

If the upstream `main` branch has been updated while working, integrate changes into your feature branch to avoid conflicts:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push
```

### Pull Requests

We use Pull Requests (PRs) to review and merge changes:

**Open a Pull Request to the main repository:**
- Target the main branch (or the branch specified by maintainers)
- Provide a clear title and detailed description of your changes
- Reference any related issues (e.g., "Closes #12")
- **AI-Assisted Work Disclosure:** If you used AI tools to help generate or significantly modify code in your PR, please disclose this in the PR description

**Wait for review:**
- Maintain open communication with reviewers
- Make any requested changes by committing in local feature branch
- After making changes, commit and push to the same branch—the PR will update automatically

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: address review feedback"
git push
```

**A maintainer will merge your PR once it's approved.**
